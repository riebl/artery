![Artery V2X Simulation Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riebl/artery/master/logo.png)

Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP.
Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery's middleware, which also provides common Facilities for these services.

Artery started as an extension of the [Veins framework](http://veins.car2x.org) but can be used independently nowadays.
Please refer to its [documentation](http://veins.car2x.org/documentation) for details about Veins.

## Documentation

We have started to extend the available documentation about Artery and created a website for this purpose.
Please visit [artery.v2x-research.eu](http://artery.v2x-research.eu).
The [install instructions](http://artery.v2x-research.eu/install/) previously found in this README have also been moved to this website.
We welcome your contribution to this documentation effort just as to Artery itself.
